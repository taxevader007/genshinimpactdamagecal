Olympics of best damage caused in Genshin Impact

The goal of this program is to develop a damage calculator that allows you to experiment with how you could achieve the highest damage in the game which are: transformative, amplificative and additive.


Implement the damage formulas for each of the reactions taking into account the calculations of each damage formula.

You also need to calculate the damage done by a character or a team.

Calculates based on a reaction type based on an enemy's stamina multiplier.

save the values of the last 10 damages recorded in the system for later reference (simple memory system)


Show the highest damage done in the calculator so far.

variables
-stamina multiplier (The latter must be generated randomly in a range between 0.5 and 2 only.)

input
-how many characters are there 1-4
-character's name
-attack on character
-character level
-PDC
-DC
-ME

production

-Base damage
-Transformative Damage
-Amplifier Damage
-Additive Damage

Danobase = CharacterAttack * (1 + PDC + DC) output

Additionally, for transformative reactions the damage is also influenced by the enemies' resistance multiplier.

Transformative:

Danobase = CharacterAttack * (1 + PDC + DC)

()Transformative Damage = Transformative Multiplier*Character Level *(1 + %MEBonus) *Stamina Multiplier

%MEBonus = 16 * Elemental Mastery / (Elemental Mastery + 2000)

The Transformative Multipliers are the following:

0.25 for burn

0.50 for superconductor

0.6 for whirlwind

1.2 for electrical load

1.5 for crystallization

2.0 to overload

2.0 to flourish

3.0 for over bloom and super burn.

amplificative

The Amplification Reaction Multipliers are as follows:
1.5 for vaporization
2.0 to retire.

Amplification multiplier = Amplification reaction multiplier *(1 + %BonoME)
 
%MEBonus = 2.78* Elemental Mastery / (Elemental Mastery + 1400)

finally

()Amplifier Damage = Base Damage*Amplification Reaction Multiplier.

Amplification Reaction Multipliers

()Additive Damage = Additive Multiplier* Character Level * (1 + %MEBonus)*Stamina Multiplier

The Additive Multipliers are as follows:
1.15 for intensification
1.25 for spread

%MEBonus = 5 * Elemental Mastery/ (Elemental Mastery + 1200)


list of things missing

-There are 10 users and each one creates the groups when they are going to calculate. The idea is that while the program is running they make sure to save the last 10
(whether calculated by group or individually) and (cycle the last 10 damages and delete the first to add new ones if necessary)

-show higher damage

Assign a null if it is a string and 0 if it is a string
